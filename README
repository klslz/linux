Raspberry PI - Realtime Kernel
==============================

I intergrated a compatible rt-kernel.patch with the respective RPi foundation kernel.
Not all rt-patches are compatible with RPi foundation kernels. 

Before compiling the kernel and after initializing one of the default RPi configs a 

make oldconfig 

must be run to introduce the rt-patch specfic parameters to the config.

Keep in mind. The default rt config needs some parameter adjustments to make
the realtime features avialable. Without running a

make menuconfig 

session, these sources will be useless!


NOTE: 
I can not promise and will not promise that the sources a working properly. I am just using
a very limited fragment of the kernel space. I won't be giving any support for this package.  
I do use the same sources on my own RPi4. They are working, at least in my enviroment.

From time to time I plan to update the sources.

Enjoy.

Below, the original Readme

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
